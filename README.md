# Appkit

This project aims to provide an application framework for developing 
web applications and APIs in the GO language.
The endgoal is to provide a complete framework similar to [Meteor](https://www.meteor.com/),
bit with an efficient and compiled language in the backend.

Appkit comes with an extendable CLI, a migrations system, an ORM 
and a [JSONAPI](jsonapi.org) frontend. 
*Websocket and long polling support is in progress*

You are free to use any database or backend you like, but Appkit provides 
incredible convenience around using [DukeDB](http://github.com/theduke/go-dukedb),
an ORM that supports various backends like MySQL/Postgres (MongoDB and redis coming soon).
